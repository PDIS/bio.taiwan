## **Industry Cluster  Biomedical Corridor**

Taiwan is famous for its industry clusters. The WEF rank Taiwan #2 in the world in cluster development in 2016.

Many specialized biotech clusters have been established across the island and can be easily accessed by Taiwan's ultra modern High Speed Rail (HSR) system. In less than two hours the HSR effectively connects the Nangang biomedical cluster in the north to Kaohsiung in the south, and makes the island of Taiwan itself one large, unified biomedical corridor.

## **Research Institutes**

### **Academia Sinica (AS****)**

In addition to basic research, Academia Sinica takes a leadership role in launching new initiatives in applied areas to meet a broad spectrum of social, medical and technological needs in Taiwan. Among its twenty-four research institutes and seven research centers are the Institute of Cellular and Organismic Biology, Institute of Biological Chemistry, Institute of Molecular Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Agricul足tural Biotechnology Research Center and the Genomics Research Center.

### **The Agricultural Technology Research Institute (ATRI****)**

The role of farming in Taiwan is changing. The Agricultural Technology Research Institute (ATRI) aims to transform Taiwan's traditional agricultural industry through innovation, entrepreneurship and technology-business incubation.

### **The Center for Drug Evaluation**

The Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) provides professional regulatory consultation services to domestic and international biomedical firms and research institutes. CDE assists in NDAs, clinical trials and the licensing of medical products. CDE also assists the Taiwan Food and Drug Administra足tion (TFDA) to carry out pre- and post-market evaluation of new drugs, active pharmaceutical ingredients and medical devices.

### **The Development Center for Biotechnology (DCB)**

The Development Center for Biotechnology (DCB) specializes in developing biologics and small molecule drugs, botanical drugs, as well as technologies required for preclinical testing. Through strategic global alliances and technology transfer agreements, DCB has successfully fostered the development of a complete biotechnology value chain in Taiwan, as well as a diverse array of applications for use by the private sector.

### **ITRI Biomedical Technology and Device Research Laboratories**

ITRl's Biomedical Technology and Device Research Laboratories (BDL) conducts research and development into all aspects of healthcare, from prevention, diagnosis and surgical techniques to pharmaceuticals and medical devices. BDL is positioned to provide cutting-edge technology transfer, licensing and other industry services, and is capable of providing rapid prototyping of medical devices.

### **The Metal Industries Research  Development Centre (MIRDC****)**

The Metal Industries Research  Development Centre (MIRDC) is Taiwan's leader in advanced metals research and the development of related industries and technologies, including medical and healthcare devices. MIRDC facilitated the creation of Taiwan's domestic dental implant positioning industry, and developed the first clinical dental implant assist-guided system (AqNavi) in Taiwan.

### **National Applied** **Research Laboratories (NARLabs)**

The National Applied Research Laboratories (NARLabs) conducts cutting-edge research  in applied sciences to meet the nation's long-term science and technology development needs. NARLabs' Biomedical Technology Lab offers testing and genetic modification services, which facilitate the development of high-quality, effective medicines. NARLabs employs laboratory animal resources, genetic technologies, mechanical engineering, and electronic and optoelec足tronic technologies to assist in the development of new types of drugs, precision medical technologies, and medical equipment and testing tools.

### **National Health Research Institutes (NHRI)**

As the only public research institute to focus entirely on human health, and as a think tank for the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) in Taiwan, NHRl's mission is to (a) advance biomedical sciences, (b) promote population and individual health, (c) forge biotechnology and pharmaceutical development, and (d) train and cultivate biomedical researchers.

### **Medical and Pharmaceutical Industry Technology and Development Center (PITDC****)**

The Medical and Pharmaceutical Industry Technology and Develop足ment Center (PITDC) was established by the Taiwan government to promote the medical and pharmaceutical industry. Its core missions are to engage in new product development and establish key technology platforms, provide technology assistance and services to meet the needs of industry, and lead the Taiwan pharmaceutical  medical device industries into the global market.
