Population aging has become a global demographic “mega-trend,” and the demand for the treatment and management of chronic illnesses and acute diseases and health care is also increasing. Governments and companies around the world are going out of their way to develop healthcare technologies, hoping to assemble healthcare models and services that are efficient and precise.

Taiwan leads the world in multiple medical technologies and plays a key strategic role in chip-making and ICT (information and communication technology), giving it an exclusive advantage to develop a cross-field value chain. Medical Taiwan, hosted by TAITRA (Taiwan External Trade Development Council) annually in June, gathers Taiwan’s top-notch medical device suppliers and smart healthcare companies. It is undoubtedly the best platform for professionals from the global healthcare industry to find supply chain partners and digital healthcare solutions.

Taiwan scored 86.43 and ranked No.1 in the world for the 7th consecutive year according to Numbeo’s “Health Care Index by Country 2022,” a crowd-sourced global database of quality-of-life data. Besides providing healthcare services of excellent quality, the Taiwan government has spared no effort in promoting the medical industry’s development. It has listed precision health as one of the nation’s six core strategic industries, while laser-focusing on elderly care and technologies by mobilizing the industry, government, academia, and research institutions to accelerate the commercialization of products and services and to energize the market. The aim is to make the home healthcare and well-being market worth more than US$10 billion by 2025. In response to the latest industry trends and government policies, Medical Taiwan 2023 features a total of 250 exhibitors who will demonstrate their best on the following five themes: “Digital Leap,” “Supply Chain,” “Innovation Force,” “People-centric Future,” and “All Age Healthcare.”
Visitors who see “Digital Leap” may explore the latest solutions in the Digital Health and Smart Medical areas, where leading smart medical device makers such as Faspro, iXensor, dBio, QT Medical, Winnoz, Huijia Health, and ThinkCloud will showcase health detection analyzers, wearable stethoscopes, smart monitoring, cloud systems, and other cutting-edge technological products.

“Supply Chain” will feature an integrated procurement platform for clinic and hospital equipment, medical consumables, and medical components put together by the well-established MOTEX, CSD, Apexcare, D.C. MEDICAL, Nam Liong H&H, SIGMA-CARE, and Joson-Care. Industry associations including the Taiwan Medical and Biotech Industry Association and the Taipei Medical Instruments Commercial Association will also be participating with big delegations of member companies, showing what Taiwan has to offer to the world.

The “All Age Healthcare” theme that centers around aged care/assistive devices and support technologies for elder people addresses the rising demand for the aging population, whereas the “M-novator” is staged for the first time in this year’s Medical Taiwan not only to underscore the importance of innovation but to facilitate exchanges between investors and healthcare service innovators via a variety of forums, pitches, and networking events.
The Future Pavilion is another highlight of the show that, on one hand demonstrates how health promotion, personal health management, precision care, and medical care at home can be facilitated in the “Home Healthcare Zone.” At the same time, the “Sustainable Healthcare Zone” gives visitors a glimpse into how smart and digital applications and end-to-end medical services are practiced in a sustainable way, presenting a new healthcare business model as well as a vision of a “People-centric Future.”

Medical Taiwan will be held at the Taipei Nangang Exhibition Center, Hall 2 (TaiNEX 2), from June 8 to 10, 2023, and is the most important business-matching trade show for Taiwan’s medical device industry. TAITRA, with more than 60 overseas offices, will be inviting global industry players to visit the exhibition and will be enhancing connections with emerging markets that have huge demographic dividends and growth potential. The “Health+ Conference” and a number of events, such as one-on-one procurement meetings, will be held to share what’s new in the industry and provide business opportunities for whoever visits the show.
