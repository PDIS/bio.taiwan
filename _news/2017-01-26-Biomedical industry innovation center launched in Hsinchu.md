The Center of Biomedical Industry Innovation Program was launched Jan. 25 by Vice President Chen Chien-jen in Hsinchu County, northern Taiwan, representing a milestone in Republic of China (Taiwan) government efforts to further develop the country’s potential-laden sectors of the 21st century and beyond.

Chen said during the launch ceremony that the center will help build Taiwan into a biomedical R&D hub in the Asia-Pacific while enhancing the country’s economic competitiveness and contributing to the health of people around the world.

Biomedicine is a care-based industry focused on promoting well-being, he said. It is hoped that the new drugs and vaccines developed by Taiwan firms will help prevent and cure diseases, as well as provide quality care for the body and mind, the vice president added.

According to Chen, the center is part of the Biomedical Industry Innovation Program passed by the Executive Yuan in November 2016. The Ministries of Economic Affairs, Health and Welfare, and Science and Technology have formulated four action plans that seek to enhance domestic ecosystems, integrate innovative business clusters, link global market resources and promote specialized key industries.

Established by the Ministry of Science and Technology and based in Hsinchu Biomedical Science Park, the center will serve as a government think tank on related issues. It is also tasked with initiating and advancing exchanges among local and foreign experts, overseeing project implementation, promoting investment and recruiting talents.

Equally important, it will play a central role in integrating resources from other biomedical industry clusters around the country, including Nangang Software Park in Taipei City, Central Taiwan Science Park in Taichung City and Southern Science Park in Tainan City.

According to the Executive Yuan, biomedicine is one of the five innovative sectors targeted for strategic promotion under President Tsai Ing-wen’s five-plus-two innovative industries initiative.

A key component of the government’s economic development strategy, the initiative aims to bolster green energy, national defense, smart machinery and Internet of Things sectors, as well as the circular economy and a new paradigm for agricultural development. (SFC-E)
