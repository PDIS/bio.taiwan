The 2020 Medical Taiwan began Oct. 15 in TaiNEX 2. This year, the exhibition focused on the pandemic prevention industry ecosystem and smart healthcare. A total of 202 companies were participating with over 430 booths. Due to the pandemic, apart from the physical exhibition, Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), the show organizer, had also held an online exhibition called Medical Taiwan Virtual. With the integration of digital and physical, the exhibition will help businesses to seize new healthcare business opportunities first in a post-pandemic world.

This year has been one filled with challenge. The spread of the pandemic has accelerated digitization around the world, bringing not only developments in mobile medicine and telemedicine, but also increasing the level of digitization in business and commerce. In order to help companies around the world transcend time and geographical limitations and expand business operations, Medical Taiwan added the online virtual exhibition. It has attracted 3M, Merck & Co., and other international corporations to participate, showcasing over 400 different professional healthcare products and services.

TAITRA has invited, through its 63 oversea offices, heavy-weight international buyers to attend the Online Procurement Meeting to precisely match international healthcare needs. During the exhibition, the Buyer's Live Tour event will focus on epidemic prevention, smart medical, and medical devices. The event will use live stream interviews to deliver in-depth product information to the buyers.

Pandemic prevention is the main issue for this year's exhibition. Medical Taiwan has built a comprehensive Epidemic Prevention Industry Ecosystem display. National mask suppliers, such as CSD, Motex, CHAMP Manufacturing, and Taiwan Stanch, and national protective clothing supplier, Makalot, are gathered in the show. Epidemic Prevention Mask Supply Chain Pavilion, organized by the Nonwoven Fabrics Industry Association, is a collection of mask production machinery, raw materials, and finished product suppliers, showcasing the most professional mask production industrial chain in Taiwan.

Furthermore, the Industrial Development Bureau, MOEA, organized the Smart Pandemic Response Demo Room. The focus of the exhibit spans the pre-, mid-, and post-pandemic periods. Visitors can see the results of border pandemic prevention, smart pandemic prevention, international aid, and vaccine development. The 2020 exhibition integrates numerous biomedical equipment and pandemic prevention technologies. TAITRA has also created the Pandemic Prevention Product Map for locating the epidemic prevention items, helping buyers to quickly locate the materials they need.

Smart healthcare developments have also driven a new trend of cross-industry cooperation. During the exhibition, two industrial forums, Empowering Startups â€¢ Co-Creating the Medical Future with Cross-Field Collaboration and The Medical Industry in the Post-Pandemic Era, will be held and several representatives from the government, academia, and different industries will participate, including Executive Yuan Minister Audrey Tang, former Vice President Chen Chien-jen, and executives from Taipei Medical University, Industrial Technology Research Institute, CSD, Qisda, Wistron, Advantech, aetherAI, QT Medical, and Heroic-Faith. The forums will explore cross-field healthcare and the challenges and opportunities in the post-pandemic age.
