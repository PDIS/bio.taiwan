A delegation of high-level officials from Lithuania commenced a seven-day visit to Taiwan Feb. 2 to expand cooperation in technology, according to the National Science and Technology Council.
 
Led by Vice Minister of Education, Science and Sport Gintautas Jakstas, the 8-member group comprises Juras Banys, president of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences; Romas Baronas, former chair of the Research Council of Lithuania; and Virginijus Siksnys, professor at Vilnius University.
 
During the bilateral cooperation meeting on the same day, NSTC Minister Wu Tsung-tsong said he was deeply impressed by Lithuaniaâ€™s achievements in fundamental scientific research during his visit to the country in Oct. 2021. Taiwan seeks closer exchanges with the EU member state on forward-looking technologies and personnel cultivation, he added.
 
The meeting explored collaborative opportunities in fields such as biomedical research and laser technology, specifically CRISPR gene editing and crystal laser technologies, the NSTC said. The two sides plan to jointly host conferences and gradually escalate the level and scale of cooperation in the future, the council added.
 
According to the NSTC, the delegation will visit the Ministry of Education, major universities and research institutes. Prestigious facilities on the schedule include Academia Sinica, the Taiwan Semiconductor Research Institute and the National Taiwan University Cancer Center.
 
Taiwan and Lithuania are boosting two-way ties, the NSTC said, adding that this is evidenced by the visit of a cross-ministry delegation from Taiwan to the EU member state in 2021, which included the signing of six memoranda of understanding on cooperation in biotechnology, business opportunities and financing, crystal laser technology, satellites and semiconductor.
