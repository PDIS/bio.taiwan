A delegation of 82 Taiwan-based tech startups is attending the Taipei Tech Arena Pavilion at the Consumer Electronics Show Jan. 7-10 in Las Vegas, underscoring the country’s key role in the global information and communication technology sector.
 
Organized by the Ministry of Science and Technology and Taipei City-based TTA, the pavilion showcases firms developing the latest innovations across fields such as artificial intelligence, smart health care, Internet of Things, software and wearable devices.
 
Visiting the pavilion, MOST Deputy Minister Hsu Yu-chin said the government is committed to helping Taiwan startups foster connections with foreign counterparts, adding that the increasing number of awards won by local companies underscores global recognition for their achievements.
 
Case in point are the 13 Taiwan startups unveiled as winners of the prestigious 2020 CES Innovation Awards Jan. 8. Among them is New Taipei City-based Ganzin Technology, whose novel eye tracking module for AR/VR can unlock the potential of extended reality worlds through ocular navigation.
 
Other winners are creating pioneering AI solutions, including AgriTalk Technology Inc., which won for its revolutionary agricultural management system that utilizes specially tailored algorithms to regulate fertilization and pest control.
 
Happy Island Tech Co. is another exciting local startup, winning a prize for the world’s first water proof audio headset that works via bone conduction rather than traditional ear pieces. Equally impressive is Yunyun AI Baby Camera Co., whose smart baby monitors can send proactive alerts to safeguard young children.
 
Launched in 1967, CES is considered one of the world’s big three technology expos alongside Computex Taipei and CeBit in Germany. This year’s edition features more than 4,500 companies with attendees coming from over 150 countries and territories, according to organizers. (RAY-E)
