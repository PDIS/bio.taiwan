Four Taiwan hospitals took multiple awards in the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society APAC conference and exhibition underway through Oct. 4 in Seoul, underscoring the nation’s capability in smart health innovations.

Among facilities recognized at the event were: northern city, Taoyuan’s Chang Gung Memorial Hospital; central city, Taichung’s China Medical University Hospital and Veterans General Hospital; and southern city, Tainan’s Municipal Hospital, the National Science and Technology Council said. 

For the first time at the annual event, the NSTC fielded a Taiwan Smart Health Pavilion, where five hospitals, including Tainan City-based National Cheng Kung University Hospital and southern city Kaohsiung’s Medical University Hospital, showcased smart medicine innovations that proactively address challenges in global digital health through international collaboration.

Through the support of NSTC’s smart medicine academia-industry alliance project, the five hospitals displayed diagnostic efficiency and treatment quality technology which incorporated artificial intelligence and information and communication technology.
Andrea T. J. Hsu, director general of the NSTC’s Department of Academia-Industry Collaboration and Science Park Affairs, said that Taiwan offers AI solutions that can be used to care for patients both in hospitals and in the home. 

HIMSS is a mission-driven nonprofit, offering expertise in health innovation, public policy, workforce development, research and digital health transformation to advise leaders, stakeholders and influencers across the global health ecosystem on best practice, the NSTC added.
