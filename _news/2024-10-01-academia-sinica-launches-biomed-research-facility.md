Academia Sinica yesterday announced the launch of the Biomedical Translation Research Center (BioTReC) Nucleic Acid Pilot Plant during an event unveiling plaques for the National Biotechnology Research Park (NBRP) Academy and the Academic Research Translation Office in Taipei.

The announcement was made during the second annual NBRP Pitch Day, which began yesterday at the NBRP and ends today. The event invites prominent professionals in the biotechnology field in Taiwan and abroad to share their experiences and exchange views with biomedical start-ups in Taiwan.

It is jointly held by Academia Sinica’s BioTReC, the National Health Research Institutes and China Medical University, and co-organized by 27 other academic or medical institutions.

Academia Sinica President James Liao (廖俊智) said the Nucleic Acid Pilot Plant meets international standards and is expected to expedite clinical applications in the research and development of nucleic acid-based drugs.

The plant is Taiwan’s first platform that can wholly connect and augment the production processes of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and mRNA lipid nanoparticles, meeting quality control criteria and tailored to industrial needs, Liao said.

Quality control testing techniques for more than 20 drug ingredients and products have been established for small-scale designs, production and clinical tests of nucleic acid-based medications for laboratory use, to facilitate clinical research in Taiwan in line with international standards, he said.

The NBRP Academy would provide entrepreneurial training programs for people with biomedical expertise or those who aspire to start their own biomedical business, he said.

By enhancing their ability to run and operate a business, the academy would help biomedical professionals carve out a smooth career from laboratory to industry, he added.

The Academic Research Translation Office, cofounded by 27 universities and hospitals, is expected to facilitate exchanges and collaborations between the biomedical academia and industry, Liao said.
