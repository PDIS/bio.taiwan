A short film spotlighting the ways Taiwan Can Help advance global health was released May 1 by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the lead up to the 76th session of the World Health Assembly set to take place May 21-30 in Geneva, Switzerland.
 
Through various news reports running on the TV in a doctor’s living room, “The Doctor Is In” details how Taiwan provides life-saving services to people around the world.
 
One salient example is the Taiwan International Healthcare Training Center, which has helped train over 2,000 medical professionals from 77 countries in the past 20 years. Taiwan has also offered direct medical aid and technical services to African countries since the 1950s.
 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan assisted its allies in maintaining maternal care, according to the film. Equally impressive is Taiwan’s world-leading national healthcare system that covers 99.9 percent of the country’s population and includes foreign national residents.
 
Given the country’s contributions and accomplishments, the film ends with a call to “Let Taiwan Help," the MOFA said. Taiwan is ready and able to help the World Health Organization achieve its goal of delivering the highest possible healthcare to the people of the world, the ministry added.
 
The film is available on the MOFA’s Trending Taiwan YouTube channel, as well as affiliated social media platforms. Versions with subtitles in Arabic, French, German, Indonesian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, Thai, Ukrainian and Vietnamese will also be released to the global audience, the ministry said.
