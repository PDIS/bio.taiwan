A delegation from Taiwan took part in the annual meeting of the Chicago-headquartered Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society March 11-15 in the U.S. city of Orlando, according to the Ministry of Health and Welfare.
 
Led by Li Chien-chang, director of the MOHW’s Department of Information Management, and officials from the National Health Insurance Administration and Office of Science and Technology, the group comprises around 50 academics, business representatives and medical personnel.
 
According to the MOHW, the Taiwan Digital Health Pavilion additionally kicked off March 12 at the meeting’s sideline exhibition, attracting over 100 visitors from home and abroad on its first day.
 
During his opening remarks, Li said that the MOHW has remained dedicated to digital transformation over the past two decades, adding that another smart transformation is on the horizon to incorporate artificial intelligence. He anticipated that AI would be applied in areas such as disease risk prediction within 10 years.
 
AI can also help detect diseases at an early stage and improve diagnosis efficiency, Li said, adding that the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration is continuing to issue relevant licenses for AI medical devices.
 
The MOHW said that one highlight of the pavilion is a section explaining how the ministry’s information systems optimize medical services ranging from smart pharmacies and wards to remote and home health care. All such comprehensive services require a digital health platform to further enhance quality and efficiency, the ministry said.
 
Taiwan is leading development in this field, the MOHW said, citing an initiative launched by the ministry earlier this year that aims to establish big data databases and apply AI technology to advance smart governance and promote the data economy.
 
Founded in 1961, HIMSS is committed to reforming the global health ecosystem through the power of information and technology. Its members include over 125,000 individuals, 500-plus nonprofit partners and more than 550 health service organizations.
