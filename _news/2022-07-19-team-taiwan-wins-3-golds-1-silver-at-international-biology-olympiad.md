Team Taiwan won three gold medals and one silver at the 33rd International Biology Olympiad hosted by Armenia, according to the Ministry of Education July 18.
 
Staged July 10 to 18, the world’s largest annual biology contest for high school students involved 238 contestants from 65 countries, the MOE said.
 
Team Taiwan—which was led by Cheng Jiin-tsuey of National Sun Yat-sen University’s Department of Biological Sciences in the southern metropolis of Kaohsiung—comprises Liu Chen-an and Huang Liang-hsin from National Chiayi Senior High School in southern Taiwan, Huang Yu-chen from Taipei Municipal Jianguo High School and Hu Kai-chieh from Taichung Municipal Taichung First Senior High School, according to the MOE. To qualify, students must complete four rounds of competitions, with this year’s members selected after outperforming 3,909 of their peers, the ministry added.
 
Under the ministry’s incentive program for International Mathematics or Science Olympiad participants, the gold medal winners will each be awarded NT$200,000 (US$6,692). They also automatically qualify for admission to the biology department of any Taiwan university without needing to take an entrance examination.
 
Since participating in the competition in 1999, Taiwan has garnered a total haul of 70 gold, 23 silver and 3 copper medals. (YCH-E)stitute in Taiwan, the MOEA added. (YCH-E)
