A symposium on precision health was staged by Taiwan in the northern county of Miaoli Feb. 15, spotlighting the government’s commitment to advancing the development of the precision health industry.
 
Organized by the National Health Research Institutes, the daylong event brought together domestic and international experts from Japan, Singapore and the U.S. Participants exchanged research results in the fields of population genomics, precision medicine and big data analysis.
 
High-profile attendees included Sytwu Huey-kang, president of the NHRI; John Chambers, chief scientific officer of Precision Health Research Singapore; and Tan Ee-Shien, head of Genetics Service at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital in Singapore.
 
According to the NHRI, a memorandum of understanding between the institute and KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital to strengthen cooperation and collaboration on use of precision medicine in rare diseases was signed during the symposium.
 
Established in 1996, the NHRI is dedicated to enhanced medical research and health care improvement in Taiwan.
 
Medical and precision health is an essential component of the six core strategic industries, which were unveiled by President Tsai during her 2020 inauguration. The six sectors build on the five-plus-two innovative industries program. The other key areas targeted for growth are cybersecurity; green energy; information and digital technology; national defense; and strategic stockpile industries.
