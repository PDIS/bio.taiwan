Deputy Minister of Health and Welfare Lin Ching-yi led a delegation to attend the 14th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation High-Level Meeting on Health and the Economy in Lima, Peru, Aug. 18, underscoring the government’s commitment to expanding medical cooperation.

Accompanied by National Health Insurance Administration, Centers for Disease Control, Department of Mental Health and Office of International Cooperation officials, Lin spoke on Taiwan experience in topics such as women’s health, digital health and climate change. 

Lin elaborated on providing universal maternity checkup services for women in remote areas; adoption of digital health techniques in tackling climate change, such as prevention measures against dengue fever and noted net-zero emissions in medical facilities with the introduction of carbon footprint verification.

The deputy minister detailed reinforcing primary medical care with digital technology to assist in disease management; vaccination for all demographics and mental health counseling subsidies for young people. 

The MOHW said that the second APEC Health Working Group meeting was also held Aug. 16-17, at which NHIA Director General Shih Chung-liang shared accomplishments in public access to medical treatment regardless of income or location. Shih also attended a lung cancer policy dialogue held by the U.S. Department of State, where he noted lung cancer patient survival rates through treatment with low dose computed tomography and precision medicine.

According to the ministry, a joint post-meeting statement was issued on health inclusion: empowerment and growth with no one left behind. This declaration expanded cooperation between the APEC member economies on issues such as gender and health, mental health, the impact of climate change, and vaccination.
