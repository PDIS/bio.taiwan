Minister of National Science and Technology Council Wu Tsung-tsong received Gintaras Valincius, chairman of the Research Council of Lithuania, May 29 in Taipei City, with both pledging to deepen exchanges.
 
Valincius’ visit follows one in February this year that was made at the NSTC’s invitation, to tour Taiwan’s major tertiary institutions and research organizations as part of an eight-member delegation led by Vice Minister of Education, Science and Sport Gintautas Jakstas.
 
During his welcome remarks, Wu said relations between Taiwan and Lithuania have been on the rise in recent years, as evidenced by the visit of a cross-ministry delegation comprising 60 plus members from Taiwan to the EU member state in October 2021.
 
During the visit, the two sides concluded six memorandums of understanding to cooperate in semiconductors, satellites, biotechnology, scientific research and finance, he said, adding that the NSTC also set up a dedicated section in July 2022 to promote the partnership.
 
In response, Valincius said he was deeply impressed by Taiwan’s prowess in research and technology that he saw during his previous trip. He looks forward to concluding more bilateral agreements to expand cooperation.
 
According to the NSTC, Valincius, alongside nine other academics and experts from Lithuania, will take part in the inaugural bilateral seminar on laser science, photon technology and materials engineering May 30-31 in New Taipei City. The two sides will also stage a biomedical technology seminar in September in Vilnius, the council added.
 
Following the establishment of the Taiwan Representative Office in Lithuania at the end of 2021, the EU member state opened a trade office in Taipei last November. The first bilateral economic dialogue was held in May 2022 in Vilnius, while the second edition took place this February in Taipei.
