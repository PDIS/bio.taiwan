The Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Industries Promotion Office, Ministry of Economic Affairs in Taiwan announced today that more than 50 industry, academic, and government organizations will present at the upcoming 2022 BIO International Convention on June 13-16, 2022, in San Diego, California. 

The annual BIO International Convention, hosted by Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), is the world’s largest industry gathering and brings together thousands of global biotechnology and biopharmaceutical leaders, and related organizations across the United States and in more than 30 other nations. This four-day, in-person event includes networking, programming, and partnering opportunities. The last in-person BIO convention was in 2019 and saw more than 48,500 partnering meetings. BIO’s one-on-one partnering platform also facilitates meetings with biotech business executives, business development leaders, and investors from premier firms around the globe, enabling incomparable partnership opportunities.

As the innovation hub of the Asia-Pacific region, and a crucial link between Europe, Americas, Japan, and emerging Asia-Pacific markets, Taiwan is actively promoting precision medicine and digital health developments. Taiwan’s over 900 GMP compliant facilities, comprehensive infrastructure clusters, international regulatory compatibility, and well-regulated intellectual property system, make it an attractive location for multinational companies to establish their regional headquarters. In addition, Taiwan government’s active role in promoting the precision health industry and information technology, coupled with the region’s friendly investment, fundraising and financing environment help foster interdisciplinary research and entrepreneurship. These resources and support proved especially beneficial to Taiwan’s startup industries, which are currently enjoying strong growth despite the pandemic. 

For the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan Pavilion will bring together all 54 organizations at the world’s largest gathering of leading professionals in the biotechnology industry. The pavilion will feature representatives from clinical research organizations, contract development & manufacturing organizations, regenerative medicine, agriculture biotechnology, precision medicine, smart health, etc. Taiwan Pavilion will join another 25+ International Pavilions, 20+ Domestic Pavilions, and over 250 leading companies in the biotech industry on the exhibition floor. Members are involved in the research and development of innovative healthcare, agricultural, industrial, and environmental biotechnology products.

Tsung-Tsong Wu, Minister, Ministry of Science and Technology, who will also physically attend the event, expressed that after enduring COVID-19 for more than two years, precision medicine and intelligent healthcare are BIO 2022’s focus. Taiwan’s expertise in combining disease diagnostics, treatments, and care with informatics remains unparalleled globally, besides governmental institutions, startups and pharma companies are excited to collaborate and share. All organizations are joining the convention to strategically prepare and plan for the next wave of biopharmaceutical revolutions.

The Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Industries Promotion Office welcomes all prospective collaborators to visit the Taiwan Pavilion located at Booth 3323 and join the Opening Ceremony & Happy Hour on June 14, 16:00-17:00.
