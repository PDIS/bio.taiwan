MEDICA is the leading international trade fair for the medical sector held in Dusseldorf, Germany every year.  The BIOMED Taiwan joined with the Taiwan Medical and Biotech Industry Association (TMBIA) and the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) in spearheading Taiwan's participation in MEDICA 2018 with a delegation of 231 firms.  

The groupâ€™s common objective is to raise the image and awareness of brands form Taiwan and provide assistance to Taiwanese companies in their participation in MEDICA.  

Taiwan's participation in MEDICA 2018 will focus on four key points including bolstering Taiwan's innovative R&D capabilities, marketing medical devices, gaining international exposure and establishing Taiwan as an important demo site for medical devices in Asia-Pacific.  

BIOMED TW plans to develop a business matching platform for innovative medical device firms, to provide more opportunities for networking with the international counterparts and investors to increase the possibility of global collaboration.

As smart medicine already became a trend of medical devices development, Taiwan, with its strengths in the ICT industry and medical services, is poised to play a vital role along with the market needs of aging society.  Many members of TMBIA already have tie-ups with ICT or IoT firms and are jointly developing smart, digital, and novel medical devices.  These firms are preparing to exhibit their advanced products at MEDICA 2018.
