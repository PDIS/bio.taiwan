President Tsai Ing-wen received the “110 Outstanding Biotechnology Industry Award Winners” on February 14, 2022, emphasizing Taiwan’s cross-disciplinary advantages in both information and communication and biomedicine.

“The government has put forward relevant plans to introduce the latest technologies such as huge amounts of data, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Internet of Things. We will continue to strengthen the development of precision medicine and build a precision medicine care brand that belongs to Taiwan,” said president Tsai Ing-wen.

The president first welcomed everyone to the Presidential Palace and congratulated all the winners of the Outstanding Biotechnology Industry Award. She said that the biotechnology industry is an industry with great potential in Taiwan, and there are more young generations participating. 

“During the epidemic, the development of the biotechnology industry has received higher attention and expectations, and Taiwan’s biotechnology industry has continued to emerge internationally. In addition to the R&D and technology transfer of high-end vaccines, the Academia Sinica team has recently taken the lead in the world and released a next-generation mRNA vaccine for Omicron virus, all of which demonstrate Taiwan’s strong biotechnology research and development (R&D) capabilities.”

The president went on to point out that the R&D achievements of all the award-winning units here have also witnessed the vigorous creative energy of the biotechnology industry, and demonstrated superior business strategies and performance, which is really not easy.

The president said that in the past few years, in order to promote the development of the biotechnology industry, the government has also actively made many regulations and adjustments.

“For example, the opening of cell therapy, telemedicine, and the establishment of a smart medical material project office. Now, we also predict that three laws on regenerative medicine will be enacted, including the “Regenerative Medicine Development Law”, “Regulations on the Implementation of Regenerative Medicine” and “Regulations on the Administration of Regenerative Medicine Preparations”. In the three methods of regenerative medicine, we will actively reward regenerative medicine research by adding special funds. We also have relevant plans to recruit and train talents, hoping to promote the vigorous development of the regenerative medicine industry.”

### The president further stated that one of Taiwan’s most advantageous industries is the information and communication industry.

“We also hope that the information and communication industry and the biomedical industry will have cross-sectoral links to develop Taiwan’s advantages, which is also an important foundation for the development of precision medicine. In fact, the government has put forward relevant plans to introduce the latest technologies such as huge amounts of data, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Internet of Things. We will continue to strengthen the development of precision medicine and build a brand of precision medical care that belongs to Taiwan.”

### The president expects that, with the joint efforts of everyone, information and communication and biomedicine, two of Taiwan’s most advantageous industries, can be combined.

To achieve these goals, all advanced and the government need to work together. Tomorrow is the Lantern Festival. She also wishes everyone a happy new year. “In the new year, the biotechnology industry will flourish,” said president Tsai Ing-wen.
