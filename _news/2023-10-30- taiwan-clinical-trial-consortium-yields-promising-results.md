The Taiwan Clinical Trial Consortium (TCTC) results presentation on Monday morning has yielded promising numbers. Health Minister Hsueh Jui-yuan (薛瑞元) spoke at the conference, saying that Taiwan’s medical strength is unexpectedly comparable to that of the international community despite the island’s smaller population.

Since its establishment in 2011, the TCTC has united a total of 12 clinical trial organizations which include more than 200 of Taiwan’s top medical personnel. These members have conducted more than 1,000 studies involving more than 90,000 subjects which have resulted in more than 700 successful trials and 130 successful medication launches.

The Health Ministry points out that the TCTC concentrates on diseases that hugely impact the people of Taiwan such as lung cancer, breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, pediatric infectious diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, mental illness, and many others. Hsueh says that Taiwan's biotechnology development has achieved promising results and that he hopes the public will have more confidence in Taiwan's medical industry.
