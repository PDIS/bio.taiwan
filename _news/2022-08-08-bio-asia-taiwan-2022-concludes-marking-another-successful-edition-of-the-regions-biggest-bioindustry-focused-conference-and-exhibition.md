BIO Asia–Taiwan 2022, held at the TaiNEX 2 Exhibition Center, Nangang, Taipei, from 27-31 July, came to a successful conclusion on Sunday, 31st of July.

With Taiwan's biomedical sector continuing to grow strongly, BIO Asia–Taiwan's recent success is a testament to this growth. Living up to its theme 'Connecting the Asian Value Chain', the event provided the perfect platform for the global biotechnology community to link into Asian value and supply chains.

Commenting on the significance of the gathering, Wallace Lin, Secretary-General of the Taiwan Bio-Industry Organization (Taiwan BIO) said that with biotechnology being a global industry, market, regulations and products need to be compliant with international standards and aligned with international requirements. "BIO Asia–Taiwan not only provides the platform for Taiwan to engage with the global biomedical community to help meet these requirements, but also allows the world to see Taiwan. We aim to cement Taiwan's role as an essential player in the international value chain," said Lin.

Lin also thanked PwC Taiwan, Taiwania Capital, the Development Center for Biotechnology (DCB), the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Academia Sinica, Taipei Medical University, EirGenix, Formosa Laboratories, Quanta Computer, the Taiwan Digital Health Industry Development Association, and the Precision Medicine Industry Association of Taiwan, as co-organizers of the conference. More than 100 local and foreign experts spoke at 22 sessions focused on such topics as post-pandemic strategy, advanced therapies, digital health, supply chain considerations, investment and regional cooperation.
