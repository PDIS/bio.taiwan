Premier Su Tseng-chang on Tuesday attended the launch of the Taiwan Innovation Board and Pioneer Stock Board, saying that the government's economic strategy for supporting innovative industries is to create a better investment environment for them. The government will ease requirements and loosen regulations, in the hopes of shortening the long and arduous path to success for Taiwan's innovative industries and capital markets, and allowing innovative businesses to grow and thrive as quickly as possible.

Olympic athletes must expend years of effort just to achieve a few minutes of superlative performance on the field of competition, said the premier. In the case of capital markets and innovative industries, however, development requires that the years of effort be compressed. Premier Su said that it is the government's job to ease restrictive rules, relax regulations, and expedite the approval of financial matters so that promising industries in need may benefit from the improved investment environment fostered by the new exchange boards.
