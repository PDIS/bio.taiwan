BIO International Convention is the world's largest international biotech industry exhibition and forum organized by the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) in the U.S. every year. It is the annual main event of the global biopharma sector that brings together industry leaders, top-notch scientists, leading investors and venture capitalists from around the globe, together with representatives of research institutes and universities, government agencies, non-profit organizations, and patient advocacy groups.

With the theme "Stand Up for Science" that honors and recognizes the true value of the breakthrough work biotech performs for society, the BIO 2023 Convention (BIO 2023) took place from June 5 to 8 in Boston, one of the world's premier biotech hubs. The 4-day on-site event hosted 150 sessions featuring 800 speakers and attracted over 15,000 delegates from more than 60 countries and regions, getting together to network, learn and collaborate on the latest trends and innovations in the industry.
