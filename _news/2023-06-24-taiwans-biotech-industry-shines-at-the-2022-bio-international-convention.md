he annual BIO International Convention hosted by Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) is the world’s largest industry gathering. It brings together thousands of global biotechnology industries, biopharmaceutical leaders, and related organizations from over 30 countries. As the innovation hub of the Asia-Pacific region and a crucial link between Europe, the Americas, Japan, and Asia-Pacific markets, Taiwan is actively promoting precision medicine and digital health developments. 

For the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan’s Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Industries Promotion Office (BPIPO) organized the Taiwan Pavilion, bringing together all 54 Taiwan organizations at the world’s largest gathering of leading professionals in the biotechnology industry. The pavilion featured representatives from clinical research organizations, contract development & manufacturing organizations, regenerative medicine, agriculture biotechnology, precision medicine, and smart health. At the same time, it highlighted Taiwan’s over 900 GMP-compliant facilities, comprehensive infrastructure clusters, compatibility with international regulations, and robust intellectual property system that make it an attractive location for multinational companies to establish their regional headquarters. The Taiwan Pavilion joined other 25+ International Pavilions, 20+ Domestic Pavilions (US), and over 250 leading biotech companies on the exhibition floor. 

Taiwan’s First Entry into Start-Up Stadium’s Finalists
 
14 start-up teams specializing in novel drug development, digital health, medical devices, and in-vitro diagnostics also enrolled in the convention’s Start-Up Stadium, to showcase their latest products and solutions. Two companies, Pharmasaga and PrecisemAb Biotech, competed with over 100 international teams in the championship, signifying Taiwan’s startup teams’ first entry into the Start-Up Stadium final since its debut in 2017. 

Pharmasaga demonstrated works on its first-in-class anti-diabetic therapeutics, the startup has identified Pdia4 as a key molecular target for diabetes and developed Pdia4 inhibitors that can reverse the effects of diabetes. On the other hand, PrecisemAb Biotech is developing its “Universal Antibody Lock” platform, the technology involves an additional protein “lock” on monoclonal antibodies, and allows for precise targeting and activation of therapeutic agents, considerably reducing side effects of drugs. This technology gained favor from the judges for its high commercialization potential.

Companies that attended the 2022 BIO International Convention shared their overwhelmingly positive experience at the event, meetings with business leaders and investors from around the world brought invaluable business opportunities, while government representatives gained impressive insights into global biotech trends to better adapt policies to encourage research and business developments.

Tsung-Tsong Wu, Minister of the Ministry of Science and Technology, who physically attended the event, expressed that after enduring COVID-19 for more than two years, precision medicine and intelligent healthcare are BIO 2022’s focus. Taiwan’s expertise in combining disease diagnostics, treatments, and care with informatics remains unparalleled globally, besides governmental institutions, startups and pharma companies are excited to collaborate and share. Organizations are joining the convention to strategically prepare and plan for the next wave of biopharmaceutical revolutions.
