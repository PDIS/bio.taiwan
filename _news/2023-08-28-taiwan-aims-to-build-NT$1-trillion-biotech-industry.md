Premier Chen Chien-jen (陳建仁) on Monday said the government plans to build the local biotech industry into the next industry in Taiwan to generate NT$1 trillion (US$31.35 billion) in production value.

President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) has paid much attention to the development of the local bio tech industry since taking office in 2016 and the government is now looking to boost its output to NT$1 trillion, Chen said in his address to the 2023 Bio Taiwan Committee's (BTC) opening ceremony.

In 2016, the first year of Tsai's first term, Chen said, the president launched the "5+2 Industrial Innovation Program" aimed at boosting Taiwan's competitiveness, which included the biotech industry.

Moreover, Tsai also unveiled the "Six Core Strategic Industries" program, which was built on the foundation established by the 5+2 Industrial Innovation Program, to promote precision healthcare as one of the six core industries in Taiwan, Chen noted.

The Executive Yuan plans to integrate resources across government, to map out appropriate policies and laws to boost the pace at which Taiwan's biotech industry grows, he said.

Currently, several industries in Taiwan have posted more than NT$1 trillion in production value, including the semiconductor, Internet communications, server, display, printed circuit board and machinery industries.

The government will collect information and opinions from experts at the three-day annual meeting under the BTC, which was set up by the Executive Yuan in 2005, as an important reference as the Cabinet seeks to promote the biotech development, Chen said.
