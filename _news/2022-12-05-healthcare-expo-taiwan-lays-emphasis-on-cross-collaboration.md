The Healthcare+ Expo, held at Nangang Exhibition Center in Taipei, Taiwan, from 1st to 4rth December 2022, witnessed an extravagant opening in the presence of the country's President Tsai Ing-wen.

“The Taiwan Healthcare+ Expo is an important platform for public- private co-operations in the development of next-generation health industry. It is also a key venue for showcasing the impressive results of Taiwan cross-disciplinary collaboration across healthcare, biotechnology and digital technology”, the President said.

Organised by the Institute for the Biotechnology and Medicine Industry (IBMI), the Expo welcomed more than 100 hospitals from the Asia Pacific (APAC) region, 50 industry associations from 15 countries to join in making digital transformation happen and expand in Taiwan.

“We have proposed that hospitals become a platform in which the IT/ICT industry and the biotechnology sectors join forces, propelling biomedical innovations and clinical validation, increasing the adoption of the homegrown technologies and products” said Chi-Huey Wong, President, IBMI. “With hospitals backed, the industry as a whole could grow and nurture.”

He further added, “The Expo has become a very important platform for cross- industry collaborations thanks to the Ministry of Health and Welfare’s support."

IBMI Vice President, Pan-Chyr Yang, said, “Amended in 2021, the Act for the Development of Biotech and Pharmaceutical Industry refuels innovations and R&D in digital health, precision medicine, regenerative medicine and some niche areas regarding healthcare. Coupled with the Expo’s building an ecosystem for the health digital transformation, we have expanded our reach in the said business” he added. 

The Healthcare+ Expo which is an integration of the healthcare supply chain, including MedTech, Biotechnology, HealthTech and nine- niche sub categories that the industry values, organised a guided tour for oversease delegates.

The core objective of the tour was to familiarise the foreign delegates with specialty hospitals and companies that are in the forefront of the healthcare digital transformation in Taiwan.

Another key highlight of the Expo was the MedTex Summit Asia where a panel discussion laid emphasis on Taiwan’s current practice and opportunities in steering the way towards next-gen smart hospitals and how the technology sector is setting its foot in healthcare.
