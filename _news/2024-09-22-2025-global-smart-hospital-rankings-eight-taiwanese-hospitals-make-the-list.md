With the rise of digital healthcare driven by technologies such as IoT and AI, the healthcare industry has significantly enhanced the precision and responsiveness of clinical diagnostics, treatments, and patient care. These innovations also help reduce the workload of healthcare professionals and improve the quality of medical services for patients.

This year's list includes 350 hospitals from 28 countries, predominantly from Europe and North America, with 156 and 118 hospitals, respectively. In Asia, 61 hospitals made the list, an increase of 12 from the previous year. Based on the number of hospitals ranked, the top five countries are the United States (104), Germany (27), the United Kingdom (22), Italy (21), and France (20).

Taiwan has eight hospitals included in this year's top smart hospital rankings, double the number from last year. These hospitals are: Taichung Veterans General Hospital, China Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, National Taiwan University Hospital, and Taipei Veterans General Hospital. Notably, Taichung Veterans General Hospital made its debut in the top 100, ranked 99th globally.
