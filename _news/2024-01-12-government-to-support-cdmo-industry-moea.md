The government plans to help boost the local small-molecule drug CDMO industry by cooperating with firms to jointly develop key technology platforms, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said yesterday.

CDMO refers to a contract development and manufacturing organization, which provides essential services to both pharmaceutical and biotech companies with lower-cost, time-saving drug research, manufacturing and testing processes.

The key technology platforms, which would have a high entry threshold, include active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) intermediates, continuous manufacturing processes as well as special delivery solutions and dosage forms for small molecules, the ministry said in a statement.

The ministry said it would also assist firms in conducting carbon emission investigations, enhance their engagement in international markets and simplify administrative procedures to facilitate global CDMO business opportunities.

The ministry’s remarks came after it held a meeting on Wednesday with representatives from domestic API makers, pharmaceutical formulation providers and

medical associations, as well as several health and welfare officials and researchers to discuss how to promote Taiwan’s small molecule CDMO industry.

Small molecule drugs are synthesized organic compounds with low molecular weights that allow them to penetrate cells easily and target important proteins.

The production value of small molecule drugs accounts for about 70 percent of Taiwan’s total pharmaceutical output of NT$108.9 billion (US$3.5 billion), making it a key part of the nation’s pharmaceutical industry, the ministry said.

However, many local small molecule drug manufacturers are less focused on advanced technology and lack connections with international markets, the ministry said, adding that it aims to help fims upgrade and build international links.

Rising demand for small molecule drugs is expected to create business opportunities for CDMOs. A Future Market Insights report issued in November last year said that the global small molecule CDMO market is projected to be valued at about US$124.53 billion in 2034, as the market is estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.24 percent over the next 10 years.
