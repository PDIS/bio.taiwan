Premier Cho Jung-tai said Aug. 26 that the government is committed to raising Taiwan’s global biotechnology profile via comprehensive policies and regulations, increased funding, resource integration and talent cultivation, according to the Executive Yuan.
 
Cho made the remarks at the opening ceremony of the 2024 Bio Taiwan Committee in Taipei City. The event, attended by around 200 experts, officials and business representatives, focused on biomedical sustainability, smart innovations and steps to ensure a healthy Taiwan.
 
Taiwan’s biotechnology industry has garnered significant recognition in the international community, and the medical system is also widely praised, Cho said. He cited the country’s top ranking for the sixth year in a row in the Health Care Index released by international database firm Numbeo earlier this year, adding that the regenerative medicine act and regenerative medical product regulations passed by the legislature in June are expected to further boost related development.
 
According to Cho, the government is leaving no stone unturned in developing artificial intelligence- and data-driven smart medical care. Cooperation with ICT businesses and medical institutions is empowering domestic biotechnology firms to serve people around the world, Cho said, adding that this goal is also in line with President Lai Ching-te’s healthy Taiwan initiative, promotion of five trusted industry sectors and National Project of Hope.
 
The premier went on to say that the next year’s budget for technology development will hit NT$146.6 billion (US$4.6 billion), up 14.9 percent from this year. The Ministry of Education, Ministry of Economic Affairs, National Development Council and National Science and Technology Council will further promote talent cultivation, recruitment and retention in relevant fields, he added.
 
Following his remarks, BTC convener and NSTC Minister Wu Cheng-wen proposed that Taiwan combine biomedical and technology industry resources to leverage high-tech such as AI, cloud computing and semiconductors to realize the Hospital at Home concept. The strategy will help advance people’s health, boost industrial development and elevate Taiwan in the global arena, Wu said.
