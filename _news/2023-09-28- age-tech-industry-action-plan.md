Taiwan is forecast to become a super-aged society in 2025. To ease this transition, the Executive Yuan in September 2023 approved an age-tech industry action plan, aiming to develop science and technology that benefits aging adults, and provide a range of assistance for elderly people and their caregivers. The plan advances strategic measures in the areas of industry development, social engagement, smart technology and age-friendly living, focusing foremost on the needs of older people and their caregivers. By utilizing Taiwan's strengths in science and technology, the plan will make the everyday lives of elderly people more sustainable, healthy and livable. Spurring the growth of the age-tech industry will also showcase Taiwan as a representative model of scientific and technological development that puts people first.

Four targeted areas

**■ Growing markets:** Encourage cross-industry collaboration on age-tech products and facilitate the entrance of more age-tech products and services onto the market in order to satisfy the needs of elderly people and foster the "silver economy." The health and wellness industries' total revenue is estimated to surpass NT$300 billion (US$9.3 billion) by 2025.

**■ Digital empowerment:** Popularize digital learning among the senior population to increase their levels of social engagement and economic activity.

**■ Upgraded care:** Incorporate more digital and smart technologies into systems and facilities for elderly care, thereby reducing caregivers' burdens.

**■ Optimized services:** Form public-private partnerships to consolidate data from different sources and provide integrated services for age-friendly living, thereby improving quality of life and expanding service networks.
